"HERE I WILL BE LISTING SOME POINTS TO LOOK FOR IN THIS WEB APP IN FUTURE"

1. This web app contains two parts one is NER and other is Knowledge graph visualised from neo4j graph database.

2. I have made the NER as dynamic which means that it will show u sentences when u search or click any button according to the query
   but the Knowledge graph part is still static which means it contains a single cypher query for every search button or search input field
   so it shows the same graph.

3. So we can look out for making the knowledge graph part dynamic too.
